The project is the sorting algorithm for Bubble Sort.

The project is for sorting certain data sets that are generally less than 16. The Big-O-notation is: O(n^2).

This project requires that you know basic Java. This is a beginners algorithm but one should have taken a few programming courses before doing this sort.

If you need help, either message me at aahmed58@nyit.edu, or search a youtube video on how to do it. Please don't spam me. I will do my best to get back to your message as soon as I can.

I (Ameer) is the only one who maintains this project.
